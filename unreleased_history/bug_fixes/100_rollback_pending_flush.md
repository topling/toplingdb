* Fix a bug where RocksDB (with atomic_flush=false) can delete output SST files of pending flushes when a previous concurrent flush fails (#11865). This can result in DB entering read-only state with error message like `IO error: No such file or directory: While open a file for random read: /tmp/rocksdbtest-501/db_flush_test_87732_4230653031040984171/000013.sst`.
