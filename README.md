## ToplingDB: A Persistent Key-Value Store for External Storage
ToplingDB is developed and maintained by [Topling Inc](https://topling.cn). It is built with [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb). See [ToplingDB Branch Name Convention](https://github.com/topling/toplingdb/wiki/ToplingDB-Branch-Name-Convention).

ToplingDB's submodule **[rockside](https://github.com/topling/rockside)** is the entry point of ToplingDB, see **[SidePlugin wiki](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki)**.

ToplingDB has much more key features than RocksDB:
1. [SidePlugin](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki) enables users to write a json(or yaml) to define DB configs
1. [Embedded Http Server](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/WebView) enables users to view almost all DB info on web, this is a component of [SidePlugin](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki)
1. [Embedded Http Server](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/WebView) enables users to [online change](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/Online-Change-Options) db/cf options and all db meta objects(such as MemTabFactory, TableFactory, WriteBufferManager ...) without restart the running process
1. Many improvements and refactories on RocksDB, aimed for performance and extendibility
1. Topling transaction lock management, 5x faster than rocksdb
1. MultiGet with concurrent IO by fiber/coroutine + io_uring, much faster than RocksDB's async MultiGet
1. Topling [de-virtualization](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/Devirtualization-And-Key-Prefix-Cache-Principle), de-virtualize hotspot (virtual) functions, and key prefix caches, [bechmarks](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/Devirtualization-And-Key-Prefix-Cache-Benchmark)
1. Topling zero copy for point search(Get/MultiGet) and Iterator
1. Builtin SidePlugin**s** for existing RocksDB components(Cache, Comparator, TableFactory, MemTableFactory...)
1. Builtin Prometheus metrics support, this is based on [Embedded Http Server](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/WebView)
1. Many bugfixes for RocksDB, a small part of such fixes was [Pull Requested](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Arockeet) to [upstream RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb)

## ToplingDB cloud native DB services
1. [MyTopling](https://github.com/topling/mytopling)(MySQL on ToplingDB), [Managed MyTopling on aliyun](https://topling.cn/products/mytopling/)
1. [Todis](https://github.com/topling/todis)(Redis on ToplingDB), [Managed Todis on aliyun](https://topling.cn/products/todis-enterprise/)

## ToplingDB Components
With SidePlugin mechanics, plugins/components can be physically separated from core toplingdb
1. Can be compiled to a separated dynamic lib and loaded at runtime
2. User code need not any changes, just change json/yaml files
3. Topling's non-open-source enterprise plugins/components are delivered in this way

 Repository    | Permission | Description (and components)
-------------- | ---------- | -----------
[ToplingDB](https://github.com/topling/toplingdb) | public | Top repository, forked from [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb) with our fixes, refactories and enhancements
[rockside](https://github.com/topling/rockside) | public | This is a submodule, contains:<ul><li>SidePlugin framework and Builtin SidePlugin**s**</li><li>Embedded Http Server and Prometheus metrics</li></ul>
[cspp-wbwi<br>(**W**rite**B**atch**W**ith**I**ndex)](https://github.com/topling/cspp-wbwi) | public | With CSPP and carefully coding, **CSPP_WBWI** is 20x faster than rocksdb SkipList based WBWI
[cspp-memtable](https://github.com/topling/cspp-memtable) | public | (**CSPP** is **C**rash **S**afe **P**arallel **P**atricia trie) MemTab, which outperforms SkipList on all aspects: 3x lower memory usage, 7x single thread performance, perfect multi-thread scaling)
[topling-sst](https://github.com/topling/topling-sst) | public | 1. [SingleFastTable](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/SingleFastTable)(designed for L0 and L1)<br/> 2. VecAutoSortTable(designed for MyTopling bulk_load).<br/> 3. Deprecated [ToplingFastTable](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/ToplingFastTable), CSPPAutoSortTable
[topling-dcompact](https://github.com/topling/topling-dcompact) | public | Distributed Compaction with general dcompact_worker application, offload compactions to elastic computing clusters, much more powerful than RocksDB's Remote Compaction
[topling-rocks](https://github.com/topling/topling-rocks) | **private** | [Topling**Zip**Table](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/ToplingZipTable), an SST implementation optimized for RAM and SSD space, aimed for L2+ level compaction, which uses topling dedicated searchable in-memory data compression algorithms
[topling-zip_table_reader](https://github.com/topling/topling-zip_table_reader) | public | For read Topling**Zip**Table by community users, builder of Topling**Zip**Table is in [topling-rocks](https://github.com/topling/topling-rocks)

To simplify the compiling, repo**s** are auto cloned in ToplingDB's Makefile, community users will auto clone public repo successfully but fail to auto clone **private** repo, thus ToplingDB is built without **private** components, this is so called **community** version.

## Run db_bench
ToplingDB requires C++17, gcc 8.3 or newer is recommended, clang also works.

Even without ToplingZipTable, ToplingDB is much faster than upstream RocksDB:
```bash
sudo yum -y install git libaio-devel gcc-c++ gflags-devel zlib-devel bzip2-devel libcurl-devel liburing-devel
#sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get install -y libjemalloc-dev libaio-dev libgflags-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev liburing-dev libsnappy-dev libbz2-dev liblz4-dev libzstd-dev
git clone https://github.com/topling/toplingdb
cd toplingdb
make -j`nproc` db_bench DEBUG_LEVEL=0
cp sideplugin/rockside/src/topling/web/{style.css,index.html} ${/path/to/dbdir}
cp sideplugin/rockside/sample-conf/db_bench_*.yaml .
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`find sideplugin -name lib_shared`
# change db_bench_community.yaml as your needs
# 1. use default path(/dev/shm) if you have no fast disk(such as a cloud server)
# 2. change max_background_compactions to your cpu core num
# 3. if you have github repo topling-rocks permissions, you can use db_bench_enterprise.yaml
# 4. use db_bench_community.yaml is faster than upstream RocksDB
# 5. use db_bench_enterprise.yaml is much faster than db_bench_community.yaml
# command option -json can accept json and yaml files, here use yaml file for more human readable
./db_bench -json=db_bench_community.yaml -num=10000000 -disable_wal=true -value_size=20 -benchmarks=fillrandom,readrandom -batch_size=10
# you can access http://127.0.0.1:2011 to see webview
# you can see this db_bench is much faster than RocksDB
```
## Configurable features
For performance and simplicity, ToplingDB disabled some RocksDB features by default:

Feature|Control MACRO
-------|-------------
Dynamic creation of ColumnFamily | ROCKSDB_DYNAMIC_CREATE_CF
User level timestamp on key | TOPLINGDB_WITH_TIMESTAMP
Wide Columns | TOPLINGDB_WITH_WIDE_COLUMNS

**Note**: Dynamic creation of ColumnFamily is not supported by SidePlugin

To enable these features, add `-D${MACRO_NAME}` to var `EXTRA_CXXFLAGS`, such as build ToplingDB for java with dynamic ColumnFamily:
```
make -j`nproc` EXTRA_CXXFLAGS='-DROCKSDB_DYNAMIC_CREATE_CF' rocksdbjava
```

## RocksDB: A Persistent Key-Value Store for Flash and RAM Storage

[![CircleCI Status](https://circleci.com/gh/facebook/rocksdb.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/facebook/rocksdb)

RocksDB is developed and maintained by Facebook Database Engineering Team.
It is built on earlier work on [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb) by Sanjay Ghemawat (sanjay@google.com)
and Jeff Dean (jeff@google.com)

This code is a library that forms the core building block for a fast
key-value server, especially suited for storing data on flash drives.
It has a Log-Structured-Merge-Database (LSM) design with flexible tradeoffs
between Write-Amplification-Factor (WAF), Read-Amplification-Factor (RAF)
and Space-Amplification-Factor (SAF). It has multi-threaded compactions,
making it especially suitable for storing multiple terabytes of data in a
single database.

Start with example usage here: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/tree/main/examples

See the [github wiki](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki) for more explanation.

The public interface is in `include/`.  Callers should not include or
rely on the details of any other header files in this package.  Those
internal APIs may be changed without warning.

Questions and discussions are welcome on the [RocksDB Developers Public](https://www.facebook.com/groups/rocksdb.dev/) Facebook group and [email list](https://groups.google.com/g/rocksdb) on Google Groups.
